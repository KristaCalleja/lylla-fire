# LYLLA-FIRE
A random acquaintance with an artist inspired me to experiment with the science and creativity which is CSS animations and transformations. These works draw on playful moods and childlike fantasy. My client sends me her works with layout handdrawn and handwritten and I transform them into code. The poems and designs are all works credited to my client. Works language: BR-PT.
